SD bee - Simply Done<br>
<strong>Design, automate and deploy processes for digital tasks</strong>
</p>

"SD bee" is a software program for delivering web pages and web apps for designing, automating and deploying processes required for digitalisation.

## WHAT'S INCLUDED

The "SD bee client" package contains the Javascript sources of the client software used by SD bee. It also contains a simple PHP script for delivering files that handles versioning. To use the unmodified software, you may use the SD bee website as described in the SD bee project.


For more information on SD bee, please see the SD bee repository on GitHub.

The client software can be made available for loading by browsers as :
<ul>
    <li>Individually JS files with the sdbee-client.js</li>
    <li>A minimised core with the sdbee-client-min.js, with extension modules loaded as needed</li>
    <li>A complete minimised package adapted to your needs</li>
</ul>

To avoid browser cache issues, a version number can be suffixed to filenames by the SD bee server and ignored by the included file server.
